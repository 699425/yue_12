                    <p>An astrological sign is a specific point in the zodiac that is associated with a particular set of personality traits and characteristics. It is determined by the position of the sun at the time of a person's birth.</p>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>Astrology has ancient origins, with roots in Babylonian and Egyptian traditions. The Western zodiac system was developed by the Greeks and later refined by the Romans. It is based on the division of the ecliptic (the path of the sun across the sky) into 12 equal segments, each associated with a specific sign.</p>
